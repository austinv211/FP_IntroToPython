There are 65 total Python blocks in the webpage.

We need to create useful comments for every Python code block in the document.

Ani will be doing the first 22.
Austin will be doing 22 from where Ani's ends.
Carlos will be doing the last 21 code blocks.

To make it easy we can do 3 seperate files so we don't have to deal with merging.

Otherwise we can all do dev branch commits to the existing .py script.
